# EvernoteClone
This is a WPF application that clones the Evernote app. I practised that MVVM pattern, WPF framework, Google Firebase and Azure Data Storage.
I used Firebase to authentication. New account and login steps are designed with Firebase api.
Also used Azure Data Storage to keep notes data. 
USed data binding, commands to for practising the WPF.
There is a account login at the start. If you want to try the project you need to get Firebase Api keys and implement the code to the FirebaseHelper.cs.
Also you need to implement endpÄ±ints ans Api Key for the Azure Data storage also.
